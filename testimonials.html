          "GroupValet has been a game changer for member media relations. Since
          adopting GroupValet, our lessons revenue and event revenue has
          significantly increased, due to the effective communications between
          our members and club notifications. GroupValet also has allowed our
          staff more time on the court due to its ease of communicating with
          members and less follow up with individuals. Couple the above with the
          outstanding customer service that Jeff provides, eliminates down time
          due to technical problems ( very rare ), unlike other management
          programs used. Whether you have 50 members or a 1,000 members Jeff
          treats GroupValet and their customers as his number 1 priority."

          not using it sooner. GroupValet has streamlined communications with
          our members for all activities and reservations which has consequently
          increased participation throughout the Club. Having an app and website
          that our members can visit to sign up for not just golf, but tennis,
          fitness and dining makes it easy for our members to stay engaged.
          Also, it is a powerful tool for selling memberships to show potential
          members exactly what we have to offer at the club. I love when a new
          member signs up for an activity within a day of joining - it just
          proves how valuable GroupValet is for tenured members and new members
          alike. I cannot thank GroupValet enough for their help and customer
          service. Whenever I have needed something changed or adjusted they
          have been responsive and friendly. If your club isn't using GroupValet
          you are missing out on a great avenue for retaining members and
          attracting new ones."

          "I can't believe how easy this summer has been for me using
          GroupValet. Everyone in the group loves it and I never really had to
          do anything!! Once it is set up, it does everything I used to spend
          hours doing. Their support is a great help anytime I have questions,
          so there never is any frustration with the program. Also, I love the
          phone app. It really keeps my schedule at my fingertips."

          "GroupValet has been a game changer for member media relations. Since
          adopting GroupValet, our lessons revenue and event revenue has
          significantly increased, due to the effective communications between
          our members and club notifications. GroupValet also has allowed our
          staff more time on the court due to its ease of communicating with
          members and less follow up with individuals. Couple the above with the
          outstanding customer service that Jeff provides, eliminates down time
          due to technical problems ( very rare ), unlike other management
          programs used. Whether you have 50 members or a 1,000 members Jeff
