          Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American
          Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration
          Rules and, in the case of consumer disputes, the AAA's Supplementary
          Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Consumer Rules")
          (collectively the "AAA Rules"). The location of the arbitration and
          the allocation of costs and fees for such arbitration shall be
          determined in accordance with such AAA Rules and shall be subject to
          the limitations provided for in the AAA Consumer Rules (for consumer
          disputes). If such costs are determined to be excessive in a consumer
          dispute, Oozbop will be responsible for paying all arbitration fees
          and arbitrator compensation in excess of what is deemed reasonable.
          The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a
          judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

          SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. In

          Each party to these Terms submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the

          any of the provisions in these Terms are held by a court or other
          tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such
          provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
